            <h1> About Us</h1>
            <p> <strong> Reni's Bakery </strong> isn't your ordinary bakery.
            Not only does it brings the rich flavor of what other bakery cannot
            do in the same qualitative manner, we can surpass the daily quota
            of producing bakery foods with haste. Master Chef Reni Yeno, with over 50 
            years of experience, has infused AI learning and automation in bakery goods
            that matches the same food made by his own hands! </p>
